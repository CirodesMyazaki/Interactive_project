This is one of the longest lasting consequences of the pandemic, and one of the biggest shifts in labor market arrangements in the past few decades. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the share of remote workers has more than doubled, from 5.5 per cent in 2019 to 15.3 per cent in 2022, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20221108-1" taget="_blank">according to figures published by Eurostat</a>.</p>' +

While aggregate mobility data suggests that workplace mobility is returning close to pre-pandemic levels, regional data shows that large differences exist within countries: in rich regions – where high-skilled workers are prevalent – mobility is still more than 25 per cent below pre pandemic levels; poorer regions have seen a return to higher mobility levels. </p>' +

  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>Recent economic literature on <a href=https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/10/30/remote-first-work-is-taking-over-the-rich-world> the inequality of working from home </a> confirm that income and skill levels affect worker mobility. The possibility of home working is positively correlated with high-paying occupations, elevated educational attainment, formal employment status and household wealth. <a href=https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/bdiopques/qef_5f606_5f21.htm>Research by economists Francesca Carta and Marta De Philippis shows</a>,  for example, that among the jobs performed by the 20 per cent top income earners in Italy, jobs that can be done at home are 30 percentage points higher than those that can be performed by the bottom 20 per cent of earners. The richer the worker, the higher the chances of working from home. This relationship stems from the particular configuration of labor markets in richer regions: wealthier regions exhibit larger shares of self-employed people, who are better placed to work from home. Moreover, better educated workers with <a href=https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_White-Paper_Dingel_Neiman_3.2020.pdf> higher wage premia tend to live in richer regions and large cities</a>. Both labor market traits indicate that there is a high concentration of workers with greater potential of working from home in those areas.</p>"+
  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>Working from home arrangements improve happiness and productivity too. Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford University, <a href=https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_White-Paper_Dingel_Neiman_3.2020.pdf>shows</a> that employees working from home (Friday or Monday especially) are significantly happier than their peers. Their productivity is also marginally higher. </p>"+
  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>Working from home has clear positive impacts. Yet not everyone can afford it. Poorer regions – and workers – have more limited access to it. The covid-induced inequality of working from home is here to stay.</p>";
